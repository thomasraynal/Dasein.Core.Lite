# Dasein.Core.Lite

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/w7y4vx4h9sdpbexb?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/thomasraynal/dasein-core-lite) 

Dasein.Core.Lite is a library to bootstrap APS.NET Core service applications. As such, most of the infrastructure come from personal choices among the various OSS options, i.e  [StructureMap](https://github.com/structuremap/structuremap) as DI, [Refit](https://github.com/reactiveui/refit) as HTTP client ...). It has some handy features ([check the demo](https://github.com/thomasraynal/Dasein.Core.Lite/tree/master/Demo)), but all in all, you're better off building your own. :)
